Dropwizard is a set of tools and framework for buildinhg RESTful services.
Helps package applications to be easily deployable in a production environment as standalone services.

List of libraries
--Jetty-jetty server is invoked as an standalone service.no need for deployment of applications to a server
--Jersey-deafult framework for building RESTful services.
--Jackson-JSON format handling
--Metrics-for exposing application metrics through HTTP endpoints.
--Guave-provides nymber of java classes
--Logback and Slf4j-used for better logging mechanisms
--Freemarker and Mustache-template engines for building user interface


--uses Maven

Define Configuration Class
--stores configurations in YAML files
--configuration.yml in application's root folder which is deserialized to an instance of application's configuration class.
--class DropwizardConfiguration extends Configuration

Defining an application class
--brings the application up and reaady for use.
--override the run() method of dropwizard

Define a representation class
--based on the JSON file format using Jackson

Define a resource class
--Dropwizard uses JAX-RS implementation for URI mapping.URI-uniform resource identifier

Registering a resource
--resources are initialized with jersey library

Service layer
--for better exception handling and to be independent of the data store engine
--called from resource layer

Dropwizard supports JDBI and Hibernate

Health Checking-Dropwizard provides native health checking

Adding authentication
--Dropwizard supports basic authentication and OAuth
--two important interfaces which need to be implemented
  -->Authenticator-authenticate()
  	--checks whether the access token is valid
  	--if valid returns principal which is user with role
  -->Authorizer-authorize()
  	--checks whether the principal's user has enough permission to access a resource

Unit tests in Dropwizard
--check for representation-write name and code to JSON file,get it back and check for equality
--check for resource-test all the operations that can be done on resource
